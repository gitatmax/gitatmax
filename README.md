## About

_Hey there! This page is a work in progress, please bear with me._

Hi, Iâ€™m Maxwell Jordan White. I work with folks to conquer the technical hurdles that hinder their work from being the best that it can be.

Iâ€™m a web developer. Whatâ€™s that mean? I focus on technical  websites and implementing third-party apps into an organization's workflow, so that you donâ€™t have to. Let me worry about updating that page, adding that new product to your online shop, or keeping your site backed up. You can focus on running your organization.

I am equipped to handle the technical aspects of your business on the web. Self-taught, I am passionate about delivering exceptional solutions that my clients and theirs love. Iâ€™ve worked with bands, law offices, design firms, school districts, chefs.

When Iâ€™m not working, Iâ€™m tinkering on any of a number of pet projects; those are Pacmax and my writing here on this site. I love taking photos for fun (feel free to follow me on Instagram if youâ€™re into that). I love staying up on new technology, tinkering with various gizmos (namely Raspberry Pis anymore), and guzzling coffee.

## Testimonials

> Maxwell has been invaluable in helping bring our web presence to life! On top of being excellent at navigating the inner workings of our Wordpress site, I really appreciate how proactive he is in identifying opportunities to help our site be better, how swiftly he works, and what a great communicator he is. We benefit from his innovation mindset! I had such a great experience working with Max that I've asked him to help me with my personal site as well.
